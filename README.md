## Description
            
This project is a note taking application built using the back-end Javascript development framework [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and deployed at a live website via [Render](https://render.com/).

I built this application as a way to store to-do items or other important notes a user may want to keep saved for future reference. As all notes are saved server-side in a .json file, the user can easily recall back their information at a later date or add new items. 

By completing this project, I expanded my knowledge of how to use the Express.js framework and specific HTTP methods to obtain, store and save data in my own created API. 

### Screenshot of application:

The screenshot below shows the front-end of the application with several notes saved.

The screenshot also shows how the most recent note titled: "An idea or to-do item", has been clicked on the left panel and has its details expanded on the right.

## Installation

There is no installation required if you want to access the deployed application via Render which is available here:
https://isaac-fallon-11-challenge-note-taker.onrender.com


However, if you'd prefer to run the program locally, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. [Refer to this guide from GitHub if you need help.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository/)

2. Once cloned, you will need to navigate to the project's folder in your terminal and run the command: 'npm install' to install the necessary dependencies. 

3. While still in the project's folder in your terminal, enter the command: 'npm start' to run the application locally.

4. In your browser of choice, navigate to the following URL: 'http://localhost:3001/' which should show the index.html landing page.

## Contributing

The ['fsUtils'](./helpers/fsUtils.js) file located within the 'helpers' folder in this repository was referenced from the week 11 mini-project file created by The University of Sydney's Coding Bootcamp program. While I've made very slight changes, the overall design and structure is mostly taken from the  Bootcamp program. 

All code in this file belongs to the programers responsible for setting up these bootcamp modules.
